This is a web application that allows the users to add dishes into the cart by clicking the plus/minus buttons below each item.
The selected items will be displayed in the drawer and will be moved into Order list when the order button is clicked. 

Below dependencies need to be installed:

  Backend: django
  - django
  - django-rest-framework
  - django-cors-headers
  - djoser
  - pillow 

  Frontend: vue.js
   - -g @vue/cli (vue 2.x // babel, router, vuex, CSS Pre-processors)
   - axios
   - vuetify

Need to be improved: 
 - Increase the ordered_number of the items that are ordered(purchased) by API 'POST'
 - Sign Up and Log In
 - Combine cart state & log-in
